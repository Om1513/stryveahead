# Feature 0007: Testimonial Cards Hover Effects

## Description
Add hover effects to testimonial cards to improve user interaction and maintain consistency with existing component patterns in the codebase. The hover effects should follow the design system patterns already established in ServiceCard and TeamCard components, including elevation changes, scaling, and smooth transitions.

## Files to Modify

### 1. `components/testimonials/testimonial.tsx`
- **Current State**: Basic testimonial card with static styling and shadow
- **Changes Needed**: 
  - Add hover state classes with elevation and transform effects
  - Implement group hover for coordinated animations between card and image
  - Add focus states for accessibility
  - Include motion-reduce preferences for accessibility
  - Add transition classes for smooth animations

### 2. `lib/theme.ts` (No changes needed)
- **Current State**: Already contains animation timing, interaction transforms, and focus ring configurations
- **Usage**: Leverage existing `animations.timing.normal`, `interactions.hover.scaleSmall`, and `interactions.focus` values

## Implementation Details

### Hover Effect Specifications
Based on existing patterns in ServiceCard and TeamCard:

1. **Card Container Effects**:
   - Subtle scale transform (`scale-[1.02]`) on hover
   - Shadow elevation increase (current: `shadow-[24px_30px_51px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)]`, hover: stronger shadow)
   - Smooth transition with 300ms duration
   - Active state scale down (`scale-[0.98]`) for touch feedback

2. **Profile Image Effects**:
   - Slight scale transform (`scale-105`) on group hover
   - Maintain border radius and containment within parent

3. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - Focus-visible states with ring styling
   - Motion-reduce preferences to disable transforms
   - Proper ARIA labeling and keyboard navigation
   - Touch device active states

### Technical Implementation
- Use CSS class composition pattern from existing cards
- Apply `group` class to main container for coordinated hover effects
- Use `group-hover:` prefix for child element animations
- Include `transition-all duration-300 ease-out` for smooth animations
- Add `motion-reduce:` prefixes to disable animations when preferred
- Implement focus-within and focus-visible states
- Add tabIndex and role attributes for keyboard accessibility

### Responsive Considerations
- Ensure hover effects work appropriately across all breakpoints
- Maintain existing mobile vs desktop layout differences
- Preserve absolute positioning for desktop testimonials
- Keep mobile stacked layout functionality intact

## Testing Considerations
- Verify hover effects work on both desktop positioned testimonials and mobile stacked layout
- Test keyboard navigation and focus states
- Confirm motion-reduce preferences are respected
- Validate touch device interactions (active states)
- Ensure no layout shifts occur during hover transitions
- Check that existing testimonial positioning remains accurate

## Design Consistency
Following established patterns from:
- `ServiceCard`: Uses hover scale, shadow elevation, and group animations
- `TeamCard`: Implements comprehensive hover states with image scaling and accessibility features
- Theme system: Leverages existing animation timing and interaction tokens
