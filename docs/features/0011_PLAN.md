# Feature 0011: Implement Full Page Navigation Routing System

## Description
Update the navigation system to properly route to separate pages for each navigation item. Currently, the navigation uses anchor links (#about, #contact, etc.) for a single-page application. The user wants dedicated routes for Home, Services, About Us, Team, Testimonials, and Contact Us that navigate to actual separate pages when clicked.

## Technical Analysis

### Current State:
- Navigation items defined in `lib/navigation.ts` with anchor links (#about, #contact, #pages)
- Single page application in `app/page.tsx` with all sections rendered on one page
- NavLink component in `components/header/nav-link.tsx` uses Next.js Link for navigation
- Navigation component in `components/header/navigation.tsx` renders navigation items

### Required Changes:
1. **Update navigation structure**: Replace anchor links with actual page routes
2. **Create separate page files**: Build individual pages for each navigation item
3. **Extract and organize components**: Move section components to be reusable across pages
4. **Update navigation data**: Modify navigation items to point to proper routes

## Files to Modify:

### Core Navigation Files:
1. **`lib/navigation.ts`**
   - Update navigationItems array to use proper routes:
     - Home: `/` (existing)
     - Services: `/services` (new)
     - About Us: `/about` (new) 
     - Team: `/team` (new)
     - Testimonials: `/testimonials` (new)
     - Contact Us: `/contact` (new)
   - Remove the "Pages" dropdown item and hasDropdown references

2. **`types/navigation.ts`**
   - Remove hasDropdown property if no longer needed
   - Ensure NavigationItem interface supports the new routing structure

### New Page Files to Create:
1. **`app/services/page.tsx`** - Services page with Services component
2. **`app/about/page.tsx`** - About page with About and Stats components  
3. **`app/team/page.tsx`** - Team page with Team component
4. **`app/testimonials/page.tsx`** - Testimonials page with Testimonials component
5. **`app/contact/page.tsx`** - Contact page with CTA component and contact form

### Existing Files to Update:
1. **`app/page.tsx`** (Home page)
   - Keep Hero component as main landing content
   - Optionally include summary/preview sections from other pages
   - Maintain Footer component

2. **Component files** (no changes needed to individual components)
   - `components/services/services.tsx`
   - `components/about/about.tsx` 
   - `components/stats/stats.tsx`
   - `components/team/team.tsx`
   - `components/testimonials/testimonials.tsx`
   - `components/cta/cta.tsx`
   - Components remain reusable across different pages

### Layout and Shared Components:
1. **`app/layout.tsx`** (verify Header and Footer positioning)
   - Ensure Header is properly positioned for all pages
   - Ensure Footer is included on all pages
   - Verify navigation active state tracking works with new routes

2. **`components/header/navigation.tsx`** (minimal changes)
   - Update currentPath prop handling to work with new route structure
   - Ensure active state detection works for full routes vs. anchor links

## Implementation Details:

### Navigation Routes Structure:
```
/ (Home) - Hero + summary sections
/services - Services component
/about - About + Stats components 
/team - Team component
/testimonials - Testimonials component
/contact - CTA component + contact form
```

### Page Layout Pattern:
Each new page should follow this structure:
- Include proper page padding (`pt-20` to account for fixed header)
- Import and render relevant section components
- Include shared elements (Container, proper semantics)
- Maintain responsive design and accessibility standards

### Active Navigation State:
- Update Navigation component to properly detect active routes
- Use Next.js usePathname hook if needed for client-side route detection
- Ensure proper styling for active navigation items

### SEO and Metadata:
- Each new page should include proper metadata (title, description)
- Use Next.js metadata API for each page
- Maintain consistent branding and descriptions

## Technical Constraints:
- Must maintain existing component functionality and styling
- All pages must be responsive across breakpoints (360px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, 1440px)
- Navigation must work with both mouse and keyboard interaction
- Must preserve accessibility features and focus management
- Should maintain performance with proper code splitting per route
- Must adhere to existing design system and theme tokens

## Testing Requirements:
- Verify all navigation links route to correct pages
- Test browser back/forward navigation
- Confirm active navigation state works correctly
- Validate responsive behavior on all new pages
- Test keyboard navigation and focus management
- Ensure SEO metadata is properly set for each page
