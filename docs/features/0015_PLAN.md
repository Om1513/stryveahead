# Service Card Modal Popup Feature

## Description
Implement a modal popup system for service cards that displays detailed information when clicked. The modal should center on screen with a blurred background overlay, show the service title, one-line description, and detailed description. Users can close the modal by clicking outside it or using a back button.

## Files to Modify/Create

### 1. Update `lib/data/content.ts`
- Add detailed descriptions for each service to the existing `servicesContent.services` array
- Include new `detailedDescription` field for each service object
- Map the 8 services provided by user to existing service IDs

### 2. Create `components/services/service-modal.tsx`
- New modal component with centered layout
- Blurred background overlay using backdrop-blur CSS
- Service title, one-line description, and detailed description display
- Close button (back button) in top-right corner
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Smooth open/close animations using Framer Motion
- Escape key handler for accessibility

### 3. Update `components/services/service-card.tsx`
- Add onClick handler prop to ServiceCardProps interface
- Add click event to trigger modal opening
- Maintain existing hover animations and styling

### 4. Update `components/services/services.tsx`
- Add modal state management (selectedService, isModalOpen)
- Pass click handlers to ServiceCard components
- Render ServiceModal component conditionally
- Handle modal open/close logic

## Implementation Algorithm

### Modal State Management
1. Add `selectedService` state to track which service is selected
2. Add `isModalOpen` boolean state for modal visibility
3. Create `openModal(serviceId)` function to set selected service and open modal
4. Create `closeModal()` function to reset state and close modal

### Modal Component Structure
1. Fixed positioned overlay covering full screen with backdrop-blur
2. Centered modal container with white background and rounded corners
3. Close button positioned in top-right corner
4. Content layout: icon, title, one-line description, horizontal line, detailed description
5. Click handler on overlay (not modal content) to close modal
6. Escape key event listener for closing modal

### Animation Sequence
1. Modal opens with fade-in animation for overlay
2. Modal content slides up and scales in from center
3. Background blur applies simultaneously with overlay fade
4. Reverse animations for closing modal

## Service Content Mapping
Map user-provided services to existing service IDs:
- "Fundraising & Investor Readiness" → sales-strategy (update title)
- "Sales Strategy at Scale" → platform-onboarding (update title) 
- "Marketing & Conversion Strategy" → marketing-conversion (keep existing)
- "Operations & Supply Chain Excellence" → operations-supply (keep existing)
- "Financial Planning & Unit Economics" → financial-planning (keep existing)
- "Growth Intelligence Dashboard (Flagship)" → growth-intelligence (update title)
- "Sales Execution & Capability Enablement" → sales-execution (keep existing)
- "Strategic Advisory & Retainership" → strategic-advisory (keep existing)
- Render all services directly from `servicesContent.services` array

### 2. `components/services/service-card.tsx`
- Remove `position` prop and related position-based styling
- Remove butterfly structure styling (left/center/right positioning)
- Remove custom SVG backgrounds for left/right cards
- Simplify card to use consistent white background with rounded corners
- Add hover zoom animation using CSS transforms
- Update icon color to be consistent (orange) across all cards
- Remove position-specific text alignment and sizing variations
- Add hover effects with scale transform and shadow enhancement

## Implementation Details

### Grid Layout
- Use CSS Grid with 4 columns on large screens (`grid-cols-4`)
- Maintain responsive behavior with fewer columns on smaller screens
- Each card will have equal dimensions and spacing

### Hover Animations
- Scale transform on hover (e.g., `hover:scale-105`)
- Enhanced shadow on hover for depth effect
- Smooth transitions using CSS `transition-all duration-300 ease-out`
- Icon and text remain stable during hover animations

### Card Styling
- Consistent white background with rounded corners
- Uniform card dimensions across all services
- Orange icons for all services
- Consistent text styling and alignment
- Remove complex position-based styling logic

## Expected Outcome
A clean 4x2 grid of service cards that displays all 8 services at once, with smooth hover zoom animations that enhance user interaction without the complexity of the current slideshow system.
