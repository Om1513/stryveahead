# Services Grid Layout Conversion

## Brief Description
Convert the services section from a slideshow/carousel format to a static 4x2 grid layout displaying all 8 services simultaneously, with hover zoom animations on each card.

## Files to be Modified

### 1. `components/services/services.tsx`
- Remove slideshow state management (`serviceOrder`, `isAnimating`)
- Remove carousel navigation logic (`handleRollServices`, keyboard navigation)
- Remove "Next Service" button and navigation instructions
- Update grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-3` to `lg:grid-cols-4` for 4 columns
- Add second row to display all 8 services in 4x2 grid
- Remove position-based service rendering logic
- Render all services directly from `servicesContent.services` array

### 2. `components/services/service-card.tsx`
- Remove `position` prop and related position-based styling
- Remove butterfly structure styling (left/center/right positioning)
- Remove custom SVG backgrounds for left/right cards
- Simplify card to use consistent white background with rounded corners
- Add hover zoom animation using CSS transforms
- Update icon color to be consistent (orange) across all cards
- Remove position-specific text alignment and sizing variations
- Add hover effects with scale transform and shadow enhancement

## Implementation Details

### Grid Layout
- Use CSS Grid with 4 columns on large screens (`grid-cols-4`)
- Maintain responsive behavior with fewer columns on smaller screens
- Each card will have equal dimensions and spacing

### Hover Animations
- Scale transform on hover (e.g., `hover:scale-105`)
- Enhanced shadow on hover for depth effect
- Smooth transitions using CSS `transition-all duration-300 ease-out`
- Icon and text remain stable during hover animations

### Card Styling
- Consistent white background with rounded corners
- Uniform card dimensions across all services
- Orange icons for all services
- Consistent text styling and alignment
- Remove complex position-based styling logic

## Expected Outcome
A clean 4x2 grid of service cards that displays all 8 services at once, with smooth hover zoom animations that enhance user interaction without the complexity of the current slideshow system.
