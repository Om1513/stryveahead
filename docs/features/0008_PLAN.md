# Feature 0008: Enhanced Service Section with Focus Navigation and Smooth Animations

## Description
Enhance the service section with service focus functionality, navigation buttons for cycling through services, and smooth animations. Implement proper card mirroring for left and right cards (smaller part inside, larger part outside) to create seamless transitions when services are focused. Add focus/selection state management with navigation controls that allow users to cycle through services with smooth animations adhering to the established design system colors and patterns.

## Files to Modify

### 1. `components/services/services.tsx`
- **Current State**: Static service grid layout with basic navigation arrow button
- **Changes Needed**:
  - Add React state management for active/focused service index
  - Replace existing static navigation arrow with new navigation controls
  - Implement service cycling logic (next/previous functionality)
  - Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, tab navigation)
  - Include focus indicators and transitions
  - Position navigation buttons appropriately within the grid layout

### 2. `components/services/service-card.tsx`
- **Current State**: Basic service cards with variant support (default/featured), asymmetric card shapes with proper positioning
- **Changes Needed**:
  - Add focus/active state styling for focused service
  - Implement smooth scale and elevation transitions
  - Enhance existing card mirroring logic for perfect left/right symmetry
  - Add interactive states (hover, focus, active) with proper color theming
  - Improve transition animations for smooth focus changes
  - Maintain existing variant logic while adding new focus states
  - Add accessibility attributes (aria-selected, role, tabindex)

### 3. `lib/data/content.ts`
- **Current State**: Contains services array with id, title, description, icon, and variant
- **Changes Needed**: 
  - No structural changes needed
  - Verify service data structure supports navigation functionality
  - Ensure service IDs are suitable for state management

### 4. `lib/theme.ts`
- **Current State**: Contains animation timing, colors, and interaction definitions
- **Changes Needed**:
  - Add new animation timings for service transitions if needed
  - Define focus state colors and elevation values
  - Add navigation button styling tokens
  - Include smooth transition curves for service focus animations

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- Use React useState to track currently focused service index (0-2)
- Default focused service should be the "Financial Management" (featured) service (index 1)
- Implement cycling logic that wraps around (0 → 1 → 2 → 0)
- Add keyboard event handlers for arrow key navigation

### Service Card Focus States
1. **Focused State**:
   - Subtle scale increase (`scale-105`)
   - Enhanced shadow elevation
   - Smooth color transitions using existing gradient colors (#F25227 to #E8AA29)
   - Maintain existing variant styling while adding focus indicators

2. **Non-Focused State**:
   - Slightly reduced opacity (`opacity-80`)
   - Maintained card structure and variant styling
   - Smooth transition to focused state

3. **Card Mirroring Enhancement**:
   - Perfect left card: smaller part (narrow end) on inside, larger part (wide end) on outside
   - Perfect right card: smaller part (narrow end) on inside, larger part (wide end) on outside  
   - Center card: maintains existing featured variant styling
   - Ensure content positioning follows the card shape perfectly

### Navigation Controls
1. **Focus Button**:
   - Positioned above the service grid, centered
   - Text: "Focus Service" or similar
   - Uses website gradient colors and styling patterns
   - Toggles the current focused service to next in sequence

2. **Next Service Button**:
   - Positioned below the service grid (replace current arrow)
   - Text: "Next Service" with arrow icon
   - Cycles to next service in sequence
   - Uses consistent button styling from existing design system

3. **Button Styling**:
   - Follow existing button patterns from CTA and header components
   - Use gradient background from theme (#F25227 to #E8AA29)
   - Include hover and focus states
   - Smooth transitions (200ms ease-out)
   - Proper accessibility attributes

### Animation Specifications
1. **Service Transition**:
   - Duration: 400ms for focus changes
   - Easing: ease-in-out for smooth transitions
   - Stagger animations slightly (50ms delay between cards)
   - Use existing theme animation timing where possible

2. **Card Animations**:
   - Scale transitions: 200ms ease-out
   - Opacity changes: 300ms ease-out
   - Shadow elevation: 200ms ease-out
   - Coordinate with existing hover effects

3. **Button Animations**:
   - Hover scale: scale-110 (matching existing patterns)
   - Focus ring: follow existing focus styling
   - Active state: scale-95 for touch feedback

### Accessibility Implementation
- Proper ARIA roles and labels for service cards and navigation
- Keyboard navigation support (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Space)
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
- Screen reader announcements for service changes
- Motion-reduce preferences respected
- Semantic HTML structure maintenance

### Responsive Considerations
- Maintain existing responsive grid layout (lg:grid-cols-3)
- Ensure navigation buttons work on mobile and desktop
- Preserve mobile touch interactions
- Keep existing container max-width and spacing
- Maintain background decorative elements positioning

## Testing Considerations
- Verify smooth transitions between all service focus states
- Test keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- Confirm card mirroring is visually perfect for left and right cards
- Validate navigation button functionality in all states
- Ensure no layout shifts during focus transitions
- Test motion-reduce preferences
- Verify color consistency with website theme across all interactive states
- Check mobile touch interactions and responsive behavior

## Design Consistency
- Use existing gradient colors (#F25227 to #E8AA29) throughout
- Follow established button patterns from header and CTA sections
- Maintain existing service card variant logic and styling
- Use theme animation timing and easing values
- Respect existing container and spacing patterns
- Preserve background decorative elements and positioning
