# Feature Plan: Elegant Framer Motion Animations

## Description
Add smooth and elegant animations throughout the website using Framer Motion, inspired by Apple's design language. This includes page transitions, Apple-style hover effects, fade-in animations, sliding effects, directional entry animations, ripple backgrounds, and a circular client portfolio carousel.

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Install `framer-motion` package
- Update `package.json` with framer-motion dependency

### Phase 1: Core Animation Infrastructure

#### Files to Create/Modify:
- `lib/animations/variants.ts` - Animation variant definitions
- `lib/animations/transitions.ts` - Reusable transition configurations
- `components/ui/animated-wrapper.tsx` - Generic animation wrapper component
- `app/layout.tsx` - Add page transition wrapper

#### Animation Variants:
- **fadeInUp**: 0 opacity to 100 with upward movement
- **slideInLeft**: Entry from left side
- **slideInRight**: Entry from right side
- **scaleHover**: Apple-style zoom in/out on hover
- **rippleEffect**: Expanding ring animations
- **staggerChildren**: Sequential animation of child elements

### Phase 2A: Navigation & Header Animations

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/header/navigation.tsx` - Apple taskbar hover effects
- `components/header/nav-link.tsx` - Individual nav item animations
- `components/footer/footer.tsx` - Footer navigation hover effects

#### Specific Animations:
- Navigation links: zoom in slightly on hover, zoom out on leave (scale: 1 → 1.1 → 1)
- Smooth transitions with spring physics
- Stagger animation for mobile menu items

### Phase 2B: Hero Section Animations

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/hero/hero.tsx` - Hero content fade-in animations

#### Specific Animations:
- Title: fade in from 0 to 100% opacity with slight upward movement
- Description: delayed fade-in with stagger effect
- CTA button: scale and fade-in animation
- Hero image: slide in from right with parallax effect
- Background decorative elements: subtle floating animations

### Phase 2C: Services Section Animations

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/services/services.tsx` - Service cards sliding animations
- `components/services/service-card.tsx` - Individual card animations

#### Specific Animations:
- Service cards: slide in from bottom with stagger delay
- Service switching: smooth sliding transition between services
- Icons: scale animation on service change
- "Next Service" button: enhanced hover effects

### Phase 2D: About Section Animations

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/about/about.tsx` - Directional entry animations
- `components/about/feature-item.tsx` - Feature list animations

#### Specific Animations:
- Left content (text): slide in from left
- Right content (image): slide in from right
- Feature items: staggered fade-in from bottom
- Floating experience card: gentle floating animation

### Phase 2E: Stats Section with Ripple Background

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/stats/stats.tsx` - Add ripple background animation
- `components/stats/stat.tsx` - Individual stat animations

#### Specific Animations:
- Background: continuous ripple effect with expanding white rings
- Stat cards: Apple taskbar-style hover (scale + glow effect)
- Numbers: count-up animation when in viewport
- Ripple rings: infinite expanding animation with opacity fade

### Phase 2F: Portfolio Circular Carousel

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/portfolio/client-logo-belt.tsx` - Convert to circular carousel
- `components/portfolio/portfolio.tsx` - Update container

#### Specific Animations:
- Circular infinite scroll: seamless loop from last client to first
- Hover pause: smooth deceleration and acceleration
- Logo scaling: subtle zoom on hover
- Smooth transitions between logos

### Phase 2G: Team Section Directional Animations

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/team/team.tsx` - Add directional animations
- `components/team/large-team-card.tsx` - Card animation effects

#### Specific Animations:
- Founder details (left): slide in from left
- Photo (right): slide in from right
- Background decorative elements: parallax movement

### Phase 2H: Contact Section with Ripple Background

#### Files to Modify:
- `components/cta/cta.tsx` - Add ripple background animation

#### Specific Animations:
- Background ripple: similar to stats section with white expanding rings
- CTA content: fade-in with upward movement
- Form elements: staggered appearance

### Phase 3: Page Transitions

#### Files to Modify:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Add AnimatePresence wrapper
- Create `components/ui/page-transition.tsx` - Page transition component

#### Specific Animations:
- Page enter: fade-in with slight scale effect
- Page exit: fade-out with scale down
- Smooth transitions between route changes

## Implementation Details

### Apple-Style Hover Effects:
```typescript
const appleHover = {
  scale: [1, 1.05, 1],
  transition: {
    duration: 0.3,
    ease: "easeInOut"
  }
}
```

### Ripple Background Algorithm:
1. Create multiple concentric circles
2. Animate scale from 0 to 1.5 with opacity fade
3. Stagger start times for continuous effect
4. Use CSS transforms for performance

### Circular Carousel Logic:
1. Calculate total width of all client logos
2. Animate translateX from 0 to -totalWidth
3. Reset position seamlessly when reaching end
4. Implement hover pause with smooth deceleration

### Viewport Detection:
- Use Framer Motion's `useInView` hook
- Trigger animations when elements enter viewport
- Add threshold and margin for optimal timing

## Performance Considerations

- Use `transform` and `opacity` properties for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Implement `will-change` CSS property for animated elements
- Use `AnimatePresence` for mount/unmount animations
- Optimize ripple animations with CSS transforms
- Lazy load animations for off-screen elements

## Accessibility

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Provide alternative static states for users with motion sensitivity
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Maintain focus management during transitions

## Browser Compatibility

- Framer Motion supports modern browsers (IE11+)
- Fallback to CSS transitions for unsupported features
- Test on Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
