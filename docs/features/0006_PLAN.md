# Feature 0006: Stats Card Hover Effects with Highlighted Styling

## Description
Add hover functionality to stats cards where hovering over any card temporarily applies the same visual styling as the currently highlighted card (second card - "Happy Clients"). The hover effect should include the gradient background and white text colors that match the highlighted card's appearance, along with smooth transitions and accessibility considerations.

## Files to Modify

### 1. `components/stats/stat.tsx`
- **Current Implementation**: Static styling with conditional highlighted state using `bg-gradient-to-br from-[#F25227] to-[#E8AA29]` for highlighted cards and `bg-white` for regular cards
- **Required Changes**:
  - Add hover states that apply the highlighted card styling (gradient background and white text) to all cards on hover
  - Implement smooth CSS transitions for background, text color, and shadow changes
  - Maintain current `highlighted` prop functionality for the permanently highlighted card
  - Add `transition-all duration-200 ease-out` for smooth hover transitions
  - Ensure hover effects respect `motion-reduce:transition-none` for accessibility
  - Apply hover state to both background gradient and text colors
  - Add enhanced shadow effect on hover to match interaction patterns from other components

### 2. `components/stats/stats.tsx` 
- **Current Implementation**: Maps through `statsContent.stats` and renders `Stat` components with grid layout
- **Required Changes**: 
  - No changes needed - current implementation will work with updated `Stat` component hover functionality

### 3. `lib/theme.ts` (Review for consistency)
- **Current Implementation**: Contains animation timings and hover interaction patterns
- **Verification Needed**: Ensure hover timing and transitions align with existing theme tokens for consistency with other components (200ms ease-out)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hover Effects Algorithm
1. **Background Hover State**:
   - Apply gradient background `hover:bg-gradient-to-br hover:from-[#F25227] hover:to-[#E8AA29]` on hover
   - Maintain original `bg-white` or `bg-gradient-to-br from-[#F25227] to-[#E8AA29]` based on `highlighted` prop when not hovering
   - Use `transition-all duration-200 ease-out` for smooth background transitions

2. **Text Color Hover State**:
   - Apply `hover:text-white` to both number and label elements regardless of their default state
   - Maintain original conditional text colors when not hovering:
     - Numbers: `text-white` if highlighted, `text-[#3C3C3C]` if not
     - Labels: `text-white` if highlighted, `text-[#6A6A6A]` if not

3. **Shadow Enhancement**:
   - Add enhanced shadow on hover: `hover:shadow-[24px_30px_51px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.15)]`
   - Maintain current shadow: `shadow-[24px_30px_51px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)]` as default

4. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - Include `motion-reduce:transition-none` to respect reduced motion preferences
   - Add proper focus-visible states for keyboard navigation
   - Ensure hover effects are also triggered by focus states for keyboard users

### CSS Class Structure
The updated stat component should use the following Tailwind classes pattern:
```
className="relative w-[293px] h-[152px] rounded-2xl shadow-[24px_30px_51px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.10)] hover:shadow-[24px_30px_51px_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.15)] mx-auto transition-all duration-200 ease-out motion-reduce:transition-none hover:bg-gradient-to-br hover:from-[#F25227] hover:to-[#E8AA29] focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-orange-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 ${highlighted ? 'bg-gradient-to-br from-[#F25227] to-[#E8AA29]' : 'bg-white'}"
```

With corresponding text elements getting `hover:text-white` classes added to their existing conditional styling.

## Quality Assurance Requirements
1. **Visual Consistency**: Hover state should exactly match the appearance of the permanently highlighted card
2. **Smooth Transitions**: All style changes should transition smoothly over 200ms
3. **Accessibility**: Respect reduced motion preferences and provide proper focus states
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify hover effects work consistently across modern browsers
5. **Responsive Behavior**: Ensure hover effects work appropriately on touch devices with proper fallbacks
