# Feature 0005: Enhanced Team Page with Figma Design Matching and Hover Effects

## Description
Enhance the existing Team page to more precisely match the Figma design specifications while adding interactive hover functionality to team member cards. The implementation should maintain consistency with the website's overall design system and allow for future content editing.

## Files to Modify

### 1. `components/team/team-card.tsx`
- **Current Implementation**: Basic team card with static styling and no hover states
- **Required Changes**:
  - Add hover transition effects using CSS transforms and opacity changes
  - Implement focus-visible states for keyboard accessibility
  - Add smooth transitions that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
  - Maintain current styling structure while adding interactive states
  - Ensure hover states work on both card container and image elements

### 2. `components/team/team.tsx`
- **Current Implementation**: Grid layout with decorative SVG elements and positioning
- **Required Changes**:
  - Review and adjust spacing/positioning to match Figma specifications exactly
  - Verify decorative element positioning aligns with design
  - Ensure grid layout and card positioning matches Figma measurements
  - Maintain current responsive behavior while improving design fidelity

### 3. `lib/theme.ts` (if hover colors/effects need theme tokens)
- **Potential Addition**: Add hover-specific color tokens or transition values if not already defined in Tailwind config

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hover Effects Algorithm
1. **Card Hover State**:
   - Apply subtle scale transform (e.g., `scale-[1.02]`) on hover
   - Add shadow enhancement or glow effect
   - Implement smooth transition duration (200-300ms)
   - Ensure transition respects `motion-reduce:transition-none`

2. **Image Hover State**:
   - Apply subtle zoom effect to image within card bounds
   - Maintain image aspect ratio and prevent overflow
   - Coordinate with card hover for unified interaction

3. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - Add `focus-visible:` states that mirror hover effects
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Maintain color contrast standards during transitions

### Design Matching Improvements
1. **Spacing Verification**:
   - Compare current measurements with Figma specifications
   - Adjust gap values, padding, and margin to match exactly
   - Verify card dimensions align with design requirements

2. **Visual Consistency**:
   - Ensure shadow, border-radius, and color values match Figma
   - Verify typography sizing and spacing matches design specifications
   - Confirm decorative element positioning and sizing

## Success Criteria
- Team cards have smooth, accessible hover effects
- All spacing and measurements precisely match Figma design
- Hover states work consistently across desktop and mobile
- Keyboard navigation and focus states function properly
- Content structure allows for easy future editing via `lib/data/content.ts`
- Performance impact is minimal (no layout shifts or jank)
- Hover effects respect user motion preferences

## Notes
- Current team member data is stored in `lib/data/content.ts` and should remain editable
- Existing decorative SVG elements and their positioning should be preserved unless they conflict with Figma design
- Featured member styling (gradient text) should be maintained
- Mobile responsiveness should be tested to ensure hover effects work appropriately on touch devices
