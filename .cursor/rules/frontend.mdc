# Frontend Rules – Finanxe Landing

## Framework and Rendering
- Use Next.js App Router. Prefer server components; use client components only for interactivity.
- The landing page is static by default. Avoid client data fetching.

## Styling and Tokens
- TailwindCSS is the primary styling method.
- All colors, radii, shadows, and any off-scale spacing are defined in Tailwind theme extensions or a theme helper. Do not hardcode hex values in components.
- Mobile-first responsive classes. Validate layouts at 360, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440 widths.

## Typography
- Load fonts with next/font and apply font variables at the html root in layout.tsx.
- Match Figma font sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing exactly.
- Enforce a semantic heading hierarchy that matches the visual order.

## Components
- Create Container for consistent max-width and horizontal padding that matches the Figma grid.
- Build sections as separate components: Header, Hero, Services, About, Stats, Team, Testimonials, Cta, Footer.
- Extract small building blocks: ServiceCard, Stat, TeamCard, Testimonial, FeatureItem, etc.
- All component props are typed and minimal.

## shadcn/ui and Icons
- Add only the components you need, such as Button, Card, Input, Badge.
- Do not edit library internals; wrap for variations.
- Use lucide-react icons with consistent size and stroke.

## Layout and Pixel Perfection
- Recreate the Figma grid and container width. Align spacing to tokens.
- Use an overlay or side-by-side comparison to confirm 1-to-1 alignment.
- If Figma uses unique spacing not on the scale, add it to the theme; do not guess.

## Images and Media
- Use next/image for all images. Provide width, height, and sizes attributes.
- Mark above-the-fold images as priority.
- Decorative images should have empty alt to avoid noise for assistive tech.

## Interactions and Motion
- Buttons and links require hover and focus-visible states.
- Use lightweight CSS transitions. Avoid heavy animation libraries.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences.

## Global Styles
- Keep globals.css minimal. Add only shared utilities such as gradient or dotted patterns needed by the design.
- No global resets beyond Tailwind’s preflight unless required by the design.

## QA Checklist per Section
- Figma spacing, radius, and shadow parity.
- Keyboard traversal works.
- Text wraps gracefully at all breakpoints.
- Images are crisp, correctly sized, and not stretched.
