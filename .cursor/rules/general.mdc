# General Project Rules â€“ Finanxe Landing

## Mission
Pixel-perfect landing page that matches the Figma design using Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Ground Rules
- Ship complete files with imports and types. No placeholders or ellipses.
- Use TypeScript across the project. Disallow implicit any.
- One component = one responsibility. Keep components small and pure.
- Order of priorities: accessibility, performance, maintainability, then micro-optimizations.
- The build must match Figma exactly for spacing, typography, radii, shadows, and layout.

## Accessibility
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible and have visible focus states.
- Every image has alt text. Decorative images use empty alt.
- Use a single h1 per page, then h2 for major sections, h3 for subsections.
- Maintain color contrast that meets WCAG AA or better.

## Performance
- Lighthouse: desktop >= 95, mobile >= 90.
- First-load JavaScript < 130 kB gzipped whenever possible.
- Load fonts with next/font; do not use CSS @import.
- Use next/image for all images with correct width, height, and sizes.

## File Structure
- app: layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css, fonts, images
- components: Header, Hero, Services, About, Stats, Team, Testimonials, Cta, Footer, shared primitives
- lib: theme tokens, small utilities

## Commit Rules
- Commit per section or component with clear scope.
- Run lint and typecheck before pushing.
- PR checklist: accessibility, performance, token usage, and Figma parity.

## Definition of Done
- Visual parity verified against Figma for all sections.
- Accessibility checks pass via keyboard and screen-reader basics.
- Performance budget met and images optimized.
- Deployed preview link available.
